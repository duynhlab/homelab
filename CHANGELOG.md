# What's next?

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-02

### Changed
- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Updated README.md Technology Stack: Go 1.21 → 1.23, Gorilla Mux → Gin, added APM dependencies (OpenTelemetry, Zap, Pyroscope)
  - Updated README.md Architecture section: Replaced simple diagram with comprehensive 3-layer architecture + APM stack diagram
  - Fixed deployment order in docs/README.md "Deploy Everything" section to match actual sequence
  - Updated AGENTS.md script naming categories to reflect new script numbers (03, 04, 05-06, 07, 08, 09, 10-12)
  - Updated AGENTS.md deployment order comment to reflect correct script numbers
  - Updated AGENTS.md "Last Updated" date from November 2024 to December 2024
- **Documentation Improvements**:
  - Added Quick Summary sections to all APM documentation files (README.md, LOGGING.md, TRACING.md, PROFILING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - Added Quick Summary sections to all Monitoring documentation files (METRICS.md, VARIABLES_REGEX.md, PROMETHEUS_RATE_EXPLAINED.md, METRICS_LABEL_SOLUTIONS.md, TIME_RANGE_AND_RATE_INTERVAL.md)
  - Each Quick Summary includes: Objectives, Learning Outcomes, Keywords, and Technologies
  - Improves documentation discoverability and helps readers quickly understand what they'll learn
- **k6 Load Test Optimization**:
  - Reduced health check frequency from 100% to 10% of iterations in both test scripts (`load-test.js` and `load-test-multiple-scenarios.js`)
  - 90% reduction in health check traffic (from ~200 to ~20 health checks per iteration cycle with 200 VUs)
  - Health checks are for monitoring, not load testing; Prometheus/Kubernetes probes already handle health monitoring
  - Cleaner Grafana metrics focused on actual business API endpoints

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-02

### Changed
- **Script Renaming for Deployment Order**:
  - Monitoring: `05-deploy-monitoring.sh` → `03-deploy-monitoring.sh`
  - APM: `17-deploy-apm.sh` → `04-deploy-apm.sh`, `14-deploy-tempo.sh` → `04a-deploy-tempo.sh`, `15-deploy-pyroscope.sh` → `04b-deploy-pyroscope.sh`, `16-deploy-loki.sh` → `04c-deploy-loki.sh`
  - Build: `03-build-microservices.sh` → `05-build-microservices.sh`
  - Deploy apps: `04-deploy-microservices.sh` → `06-deploy-microservices.sh`
  - k6: `06-deploy-k6-testing.sh` → `07-deploy-k6-testing.sh`
  - SLO: `11-deploy-slo.sh` → `08-deploy-slo.sh`, `09-validate-slo.sh` → `08a-validate-slo.sh`, `10-generate-slo-rules.sh` → `08b-generate-slo-rules.sh`
  - Access: `07-setup-access.sh` → `09-setup-access.sh`
  - Utilities: `08-reload-dashboard.sh` → `10-reload-dashboard.sh`, `12-diagnose-latency.sh` → `11-diagnose-latency.sh`, `13-error-budget-alert.sh` → `12-error-budget-alert.sh`
  - Updated all internal script references and documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md, SETUP.md, .claude/commands/deploy.md)
- **Vector Configuration Simplified** (`k8s/vector/configmap.yaml`):
  - Removed complex JSON parsing logic from VRL transforms
  - Simplified to only add labels from pod metadata (service, namespace, pod, container)
  - Added batching (3MB max bytes, 5s timeout) and rate limiting (100 requests/second)
  - Improved label fallbacks: use `pod_name` as service fallback, "system" instead of "unknown" to avoid too many logs in single stream
  - Added `out_of_order_action: accept` to handle out-of-order log events
- **Loki Configuration Enhanced** (`k8s/loki/configmap.yaml`):
  - Increased ingestion limits: 64MB/s rate, 128MB burst (from 16MB/s, 32MB burst)
  - Increased max_streams_per_user: 10000 → 50000
  - Increased per_stream_rate_limit: 3MB → 50MB (with 100MB burst)
  - Increased gRPC message size: 4MB → 10MB (grpc_server_max_recv_msg_size, grpc_server_max_send_msg_size)
  - Added `volume_enabled: true` for log volume queries API support
- **Vector Moved to kube-system Namespace**:
  - Moved Vector DaemonSet from `monitoring` to `kube-system` namespace for better log collection coverage
  - Updated RBAC: Added `nodes` resource permissions to ClusterRole for Vector to read node information
  - Added `VECTOR_SELF_NODE_NAME` environment variable using Kubernetes Downward API (`spec.nodeName`)
  - Enabled Vector API for health checks (port 8686)

### Fixed
- **Vector → Loki Pipeline Issues**:
  - Fixed VRL errors: Changed `string()` to `to_string()` for infallible type conversion in Vector transforms
  - Fixed 429 Too Many Requests: Increased Loki ingestion limits (64MB/s rate, 128MB burst) and per-stream rate limits (3MB → 50MB)
  - Fixed 500 Internal Server Error: Increased gRPC message size limits (4MB → 10MB) and reduced Vector batch size (10MB → 3MB)
  - Fixed per-stream rate limit exceeded: Increased from 3MB to 50MB, improved label fallbacks to avoid too many "unknown" streams
  - Fixed out-of-order events: Added `out_of_order_action: accept` to Vector Loki sink configuration


## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- **3-Layer Architecture Refactor**: Refactored all services into web → logic → core layers
  - `web/v1/`, `web/v2/` - HTTP handlers (Gin handlers) with tracing and logging
  - `logic/v1/`, `logic/v2/` - Business logic layer with spans for each operation
  - `core/domain/` - Domain models (moved from `domain/` to `core/domain/`)
  - All 9 services refactored: auth, user, product, cart, order, review, notification, shipping
  - Layer tracing: Each layer creates spans with `layer` attribute for better observability
- **Import Path Update**: Changed module path from `github.com/demo/monitoring-golang` to `github.com/duynhne/monitoring`
  - Updated all Go source files (42 files)
  - Updated `services/go.mod`
  - Updated documentation references
- **Project structure reorganized** for cleaner root directory:
  - Moved Go code (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `Dockerfile`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`) into `services/` folder
  - Moved `kind/` folder into `k8s/kind/`
  - Renamed service folders: `services/cmd/auth-service/` → `services/cmd/auth/` (and all 9 services)
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows for new paths
- Updated build scripts (`05-build-microservices.sh`, `01-create-kind-cluster.sh`)
- **SLO folder simplified**:
  - `slo/generated/` now gitignored (generated files created on-demand by `./scripts/08b-generate-slo-rules.sh`)
  - SLO definitions remain in `slo/definitions/` as source of truth
- **Service naming simplified** - Removed "-service" suffix everywhere:
  - Service folders: `cmd/auth-service/` → `cmd/auth/`
  - Helm values: `name: auth-service` → `name: auth`
  - SLO definitions: `auth-service.yaml` → `auth.yaml`
  - App labels: `app="auth-service"` → `app="auth"`
  - Alert names: `AuthServiceHighErrorRate` → `AuthHighErrorRate`
  - Service URLs in k6 scripts: `auth-service.auth.svc.cluster.local` → `auth.auth.svc.cluster.local`
  - Kubernetes service names: `svc/auth-service` → `svc/auth`
  - Prometheus SLO ConfigMaps: `prometheus-slo-rules-auth-service` → `prometheus-slo-rules-auth`
  - Go log messages: `"Starting auth-service"` → `"Starting auth"`
  - Updated all documentation (README.md, API_REFERENCE.md, METRICS_LABEL_SOLUTIONS.md, etc.)

### Removed
- `k8s/slo/sloth-job.yaml` - Unused Kubernetes Job for Sloth (scripts run Sloth locally instead)
- `k8s/slo/` folder - Empty after removing sloth-job.yaml
- Old SLO definition files with "-service" suffix (replaced by shorter names)

## Migration Guide

### From v3 to v4

1. **Update image references** in any custom configurations:
   ```yaml
   # Old
   image: ghcr.io/duynhne/auth-service:latest

   ```

2. **Deploy using Helm** instead of raw kubectl:
   ```bash
   # Old
   kubectl apply -f k8s/auth-service/
   
   # New
   helm upgrade --install auth charts/ -f charts/values/auth.yaml -n auth
   ```

3. **Or use the deployment script**:
   ```bash
