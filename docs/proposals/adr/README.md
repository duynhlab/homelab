# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Short, structured records of **one durable architectural decision** — the context
that forced it, the alternatives rejected, the trade-offs accepted, and the rules
code must follow. ADRs capture the **why** that manifests and service contracts
cannot.

## Artifact roles

Each document type answers one question. Do not merge responsibilities.

| Document | Primary question |
|----------|------------------|
| [`research.md`](../rfc/RFC-0000/research.md) | How does this mechanism, product, or pattern work? |
| [RFC](../rfc/) | What change do we **propose** for the system? |
| **ADR** (this directory) | What did we **decide**, and which trade-offs did we accept? |
| Planning (RFC rollout, epic, optional `RFC-NNNN/implementation.md`) | How do we **schedule** implementation phases and PRs? |
| [`docs/api/{service}.md`](../../api/README.md) | How does the system **run today** (as-built)? |
| Runbook | When something fails or drifts, how do we **operate** it? |

Mnemonic:

```text
Research = background knowledge
RFC      = proposal record
ADR      = decision record
Planning = construction schedule
API docs = as-built contract
Runbook  = operations playbook
```

**ADR is not:** a long research essay, a full target design (that is the RFC), a
task list, an API contract, a runbook, or a repository changelog.

### RFC and ADR cardinality

RFC and ADR are **not** 1:1. One RFC may spawn zero, one, or many ADRs. Each ADR
records **one** decision that could stand or be superseded on its own.

An RFC may spawn **no** ADR when the proposal is rejected or withdrawn, the change
is pure implementation detail, no durable architectural constraint remains, no
meaningful alternative needs recording, or an existing ADR already covers the
decision.

A **standalone ADR** (no RFC) is fine when scope is small, the problem is clear,
few alternatives exist, and no large rollout plan is needed.

## Process

1. Frame the problem (optionally in `research.md`).
2. Write the RFC with target design and alternatives.
3. During RFC review, identify **independent** architectural decisions.
4. Create one ADR per decision at **`Proposed`** (copy [`ADR-0000-template/`](ADR-0000-template/)).
5. On architecture approval: RFC → **`Accepted`**; linked ADR(s) → **`Accepted`**
   (Adoption stays **`Not started`** until code lands).
6. Implement code and tests.
7. Update [`docs/api/`](../../api/README.md) to as-built (API-touching decisions).
8. Update ADR **Adoption** and **History**; append RFC **Implementation History**.
9. Add or update **runbooks** when the topic has meaningful operational failure
   modes (observability, databases, or other area — not a single root path).

**docs/api sync (API-touching):** when Adoption reaches **Complete**, owning service
files, hub rollup, and **Design records** links must match deployed reality. The ADR
keeps *why*; the contract keeps routes, RPCs, payloads, and status. Infra-only ADRs
update platform docs instead.

---

## When to create an ADR

Create an ADR when one or more of these apply:

| Question | Create ADR? |
|----------|-------------|
| Changes service boundary or data ownership? | Yes |
| Affects multiple repos or platform components? | Yes |
| Expensive to reverse after shipping? | Yes |
| Two or more credible alternatives existed? | Yes |
| Creates long-lived constraints for code review? | Yes |
| A newcomer may ask "why did we do this?" in six months? | Yes |
| Touches money, security, consistency, or distributed workflows? | Yes |
| Changes transport or workflow ownership? | Yes |
| Significant operational trade-off? | Yes |

Do **not** create an ADR for: rename-only refactors, formatting, PR splits, seed
data tweaks, local bug fixes without boundary change, routine indexes, package moves
without boundary change, or pure implementation tasks.

---

## One decision per ADR

One ADR = one sentence in active voice:

```text
We will separate Inventory from Product.
```

If decision A can change while B remains valid, they belong in **separate** ADRs.

**Split signal:** titles or decisions chained with *and*, *also*, *while*,
*as well as*, *plus* — usually multiple decisions in one file.

---

## Status and Adoption

**Decision status** and **Adoption** are independent. Do not use `Implemented` as
an ADR status.

### Decision status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Proposed` | Under review; not yet an architectural constraint |
| `Accepted` | Approved; authoritative for design and review |
| `Withdrawn` | Removed before acceptance |
| `Deprecated` | Retained for existing behavior; not for new designs |
| `Superseded by ADR-NNN` | Replaced by a newer decision |

Typical flow: `Proposed → Accepted → Superseded by ADR-NNN` (or `Deprecated`).

### Adoption

| Adoption | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `Not started` | No implementation work yet |
| `Partial` | Some obligations complete (phased rollout) |
| `Complete` | Code, tests, contracts, and required ops docs comply |

Example after RFC approval: `Status: Accepted`, `Adoption: Not started`.

**Legacy ADRs** (ADR-001–031 and earlier v1 shape) remain valid. They may omit
Adoption in the file body; the index below assigns Adoption for tracking. New ADRs
from [`ADR-0000-template/`](ADR-0000-template/) use template v2. No backfill unless
the owner asks.

---

## Append-only rules

After **`Accepted`**, do not silently rewrite **Decision**, **Alternatives
considered**, **Decision drivers**, or accepted **Consequences**.

Allowed updates: typos, broken links, append PRs, change **Adoption**, add **History**
rows, mark **Deprecated** or **Superseded**.

When the decision itself changes, write a **new** ADR, set `Supersedes: ADR-NNN` on
the new record, and update the old record to `Superseded by ADR-XXX`.

---

## Naming and layout

### Title

Imperative, decision-shaped:

```text
Adopt Temporal for Order Fulfillment
Separate Inventory from Product
Keep Checkout as a Purchase-Funnel Orchestrator
```

Avoid topic labels: `Inventory Architecture`, `Checkout Improvements`.

### Folder

One folder per decision (matches RFC layout):

```text
docs/proposals/adr/ADR-NNN-imperative-kebab-slug/README.md
```

Keep per-ADR diagrams and assets inside the folder. Use the next platform-wide
`ADR-NNN` sequence (do not reset per service).

---

## RFC Resulting decisions

Every multi-decision RFC should link its ADRs explicitly. Add to the RFC body (see
[`RFC-0000/README.md`](../rfc/RFC-0000/README.md#resulting-decisions)):

```markdown
## Resulting decisions

| Decision | ADR | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| {one-line decision} | `ADR-NNN-slug/` | Proposed |
```

On approval: RFC → **Accepted**; each linked ADR → **Accepted**; Adoption →
**Not started**. After ship: update Adoption, `docs/api`, runbooks (if needed), and
RFC Implementation History.

---

## Review checklist

### Before review

- [ ] Title is one decision, not a topic name.
- [ ] Decision summary states benefit **and** cost.
- [ ] Context states facts only (no chosen option).
- [ ] In scope / Out of scope are explicit.
- [ ] Decision drivers are prioritized.
- [ ] Alternatives are credible (not straw men).
- [ ] At least one meaningful negative consequence.
- [ ] Implementation obligations, validation, and revisit triggers present.
- [ ] Related RFC/research linked or `—`.
- [ ] Optional diagram answers one boundary question only.

### On Accept

- [ ] Decision date and Deciders filled in.
- [ ] Status → **Accepted**; Adoption → **Not started** (unless code already landed).
- [ ] RFC **Resulting decisions** table updated.
- [ ] History row added.

### On Adoption Complete

- [ ] Obligations met; tests prove decision rules.
- [ ] `docs/api/` as-built; Design records link this ADR.
- [ ] Runbooks updated when ops-relevant.
- [ ] Adoption → **Complete**; History updated.

### When reversing

- [ ] Do not rewrite the old Decision section.
- [ ] New ADR with `Supersedes`; old ADR → `Superseded by`.

---

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| ADR duplicates the whole RFC | Move target design to RFC; keep one decision + rules here |
| Context argues for the answer | State forces only; decide in **Decision** |
| Straw-man alternatives | Record real options from RFC/research |
| Benefits only, no costs | Fill **Negative consequences** |
| Phase plan inside ADR | Link RFC rollout or planning doc; use **Implementation obligations** |
| `Status: Implemented` | Use `Accepted` + `Adoption: Complete` |
| Calendar-only revisit trigger | Use observable thresholds (scale, requirement, cost) |

---

## Definition of Done

An ADR is not complete at compile time.

```text
Decision accepted (ADR)
├── Implementation obligations done
├── Unit / integration / contract / workflow tests
├── Security and failure behavior verified
├── docs/api updated (when API-touching)
├── Platform topology / call graph updated
├── Runbooks when ops-relevant
└── Adoption = Complete
```

**Planned (not yet in repo):** structural ADR lint in CI (`make lint-adr`) —
filename, required headings, status/adoption vocabulary, Mermaid render, RFC↔ADR
backlinks.

---

## Illustrative splits

Examples only — use the next free `ADR-NNN` when authoring; do not renumber live
records.

**Large RFC (e.g. inventory domain overhaul)** might yield:

```text
ADR-NNN — Separate Inventory from Product
ADR-NNN — Use Reservation Balances and an Append-Only Stock Movement Ledger
ADR-NNN — Fulfil One Order from One Warehouse in the MVP
```

**Order / Temporal RFC** might yield separate decisions for lifecycle model,
orchestrator ownership, and confirmation pivot — because each can change without
invalidating the others.

Do **not** duplicate an existing ADR when the decision is already recorded; link
and extend Adoption instead.

_Last updated: 2026-08-25 — ADR-056 accepted (k6 assertion layer; ADR-045 sizing amended alongside it, and ADR-055 finally has an observed backlog to scale on). Previously: ADR-054 and ADR-055 created at `Proposed` with [RFC-0026](../rfc/RFC-0026/)_
