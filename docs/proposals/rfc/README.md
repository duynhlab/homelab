# RFCs — Requests for Comments

This directory is the **single home for proposing and tracking substantial changes**
to the duynhlab platform — infrastructure (this repo) *and* the microservice code.
Every substantial topic **reserves an RFC number first**, explores in **`research.md`**,
then writes the decision in **`README.md`**.

Overview and lifecycle diagram: [`docs/proposals/README.md`](../README.md). **Index and
backlog live in this file.**

> **Don't forget: every decision is a tradeoff.** A good RFC states what the choice
> *costs* (rejected alternatives + drawbacks + rollback), not just what it buys.

## When to write an RFC

Write an RFC for a **substantial** change — one that needs a design + review + a
diagram *before* anyone builds it. Examples:

- **API additions** — new kinds of resources, new relationships between existing APIs.
- **API breaking changes** — new required fields, field removals, response-shape changes.
- **Security-related changes** — Flux controller permissions, east-west mTLS, tenant
  isolation / impersonation, trust-boundary moves.
- **Impactful UX changes** — new required inputs to the bootstrap/onboarding process.
- **Dropping capabilities** — sunsetting an integration with an external service.
- **New platform capabilities/backends** — adopting a new datastore, mesh, or orchestrator.

**Don't** write an RFC for bug fixes, cleanups, or dependency bumps — ship in a focused PR.

## Process

| Artifact | File | Template | Question it answers |
|----------|------|----------|---------------------|
| **Template** | [`RFC-0000/`](RFC-0000/) (v3) | Copy source only — **never** a live proposal | — |
| **Research** | `RFC-NNNN/research.md` | [`RFC-0000/research.md`](RFC-0000/research.md) | What **real-world problem** are we solving, how does the tech work, and how does it compare to what we run? |
| **RFC** | `RFC-NNNN/README.md` | [`RFC-0000/README.md`](RFC-0000/README.md) (v3) | What do we decide, target architecture, rollout? |
| **Domain doc** (optional) | `docs/<area>/<topic>/README.md` | [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) docs conventions | How does it work **in this platform**? |

**Flow:** real-world problem in `research.md` → [research review gate](RFC-0000/research.md#research-review-gate)
→ `README.md` → architecture review → ADR(s) at **`Proposed`** → **`Accepted`** →
implement → sync [`docs/api/`](../../api/README.md) → runbooks (when ops-relevant).
Full ADR process: [`adr/README.md`](../adr/README.md).

1. **Reserve number (owner OK required)** — propose the exact next slot (e.g. **RFC-0019**
   = `max(RFC-NNNN) + 1`; do not backfill gaps unless the owner asks). On approval, in
   the **same PR**: create `RFC-NNNN/`, copy [`RFC-0000/research.md`](RFC-0000/research.md)
   only, add an index row with Status **`researching`**. Do **not** copy `README.md` yet.
2. **Research phase** — iterate `research.md`; run Context7 audit; owner review loops
   until the review gate passes.
3. **RFC phase** — after owner **ready for RFC**, copy
   [`RFC-0000/README.md`](RFC-0000/README.md) → `RFC-NNNN/README.md`; fill from research;
   set Status **`provisional`** in this index (replaces `researching`).
4. **Optional domain doc** — owner picks `docs/<area>/<topic>/README.md`; distill from
   research; link both ways; register in [`docs/README.md`](../../README.md) and the area
   index. Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) docs conventions (house shape, English,
   **planned** vs **deployed**).
5. **Architecture review** — identify independent decisions; create ADR(s) under
   [`adr/`](../adr/) at **`Proposed`** (copy [`ADR-0000-template/`](../adr/ADR-0000-template/));
   fill RFC [**Resulting decisions**](RFC-0000/README.md#resulting-decisions) table.
6. **On approval** — RFC → **`Accepted`**; linked ADR(s) → **`Accepted`**; ADR
   **Adoption** → **`Not started`**. Fill
   [**Decision outcome**](RFC-0000/README.md#decision-outcome) — the chosen option
   named as § Alternatives names it, plus the rationale against § Goals. Legacy index
   rows labelled **`implementable`** mean the same as **`Accepted`**.
7. **Implement** → RFC Status **`implemented`**; ADR **Adoption** → Partial/Complete;
   append **Implementation History** and PR links.
8. **Sync `docs/api/` (API-touching)** — when Adoption is **Complete** / RFC is
   **`implemented`**:
   - Map the change → owning file(s) via [`docs/api/README.md` § Document Ownership](../../api/README.md#document-ownership).
   - Update **Design records** on service Identity tables; hub rollup and At a glance rows when deploy/transport changes.
   - Service files touched use [`_template-service.md`](../../api/_template-service.md) v2 (no full backfill of legacy v1 contracts required).
   - Reuse Mermaid from the RFC when helpful — label *As-built contract* vs *Target state*; tag **planned** behaviour accurately.
   - Link back from RFC **Related** and spawned ADR **References**.
   Infra-only RFCs update platform docs instead; skip `docs/api/` unless app contracts change.
9. **Runbooks** — add or update area runbooks when the change introduces meaningful
   operational failure modes (topic-dependent paths under `docs/observability/runbooks/`,
   `docs/databases/runbooks/`, …).

Keep diagrams/assets **inside the RFC folder** (or the chosen domain doc path). Mermaid
may repeat across artifacts — label each diagram's question (*Mechanism*, *Target state*,
*Homelab as-built*, *As-built contract*) and keep deployed facts in sync.

**Duplication with `docs/api/`:** operational contract (routes, RPCs, payloads, status)
lives in [`docs/api/`](../../api/README.md); tradeoffs and alternatives stay in the RFC.
Copying diagrams or prose into a service contract is OK when cross-linked — do not dedupe
for its own sake.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **researching** | Number reserved; only `research.md` exists (title may be TBD) |
| **provisional** | `README.md` exists; under architecture review |
| **Accepted** | Review passed; linked ADR(s) Accepted; ready to implement |
| **implemented** | Shipped; track in Implementation History |
| **superseded** | Replaced by a later RFC or approach |
| **deferred** · **rejected** · **withdrawn** · **replaced** | See RFC body |
| **template** | Copy source only ([`RFC-0000/`](RFC-0000/)) |

> **Legacy index label:** some rows still say **`implementable`** — equivalent to
> **`Accepted`**. Do not bulk-rename live RFC folders in drive-by PRs.

| [RFC-0004](RFC-0004/) | Cross-service caching and invalidation | platform-wide | P2 | provisional — the RFC's own header says `provisional` and "not yet implementable"; this row said `Accepted` for weeks |
| [RFC-0005](RFC-0005/) | supporting-shared-db: HA or split | infra | P2 | provisional — **superseded by [RFC-0018](RFC-0018/)** (platform-db merge) |

| [RFC-0007](RFC-0007/) | Disaster-recovery drills program | infra | done | implemented — program documented and Drill A recorded (`DR-2026-08-A`, Barman gate closed); the recurring cadence and Drills C/D activate with durable hardware ([RFC-0011](RFC-0011/)) |
| [RFC-0008](RFC-0008/) | Production secrets hardening & local/prod parity | infra | P1 | implementable — Slice 1 (awskms auto-unseal, [ADR-024](../adr/ADR-024-floci-kms-emulator-auto-unseal/)) landed; cloud-bound items remain proposal-only |
| [RFC-0009](RFC-0009/) | Production-grade API gateway: signed JWT + Kong edge auth | platform-wide | done | implemented — superseded in part by [RFC-0022](RFC-0022/) / [RFC-0024](RFC-0024/); the Kong vehicle is gone, the signed-JWT contract survives |

| [RFC-0017](RFC-0017/) | Platform telemetry standard: per-layer signal ownership + fleet instrumentation | platform-wide | done | implemented — W0 through W4 landed fleet-wide; business-metric alerts/SLOs + ~16 catalog rows stay backlog |
| [RFC-0018](RFC-0018/) | Consolidate platform PostgreSQL: merge auth, shared, temporal into platform-db | infra | done | implemented — every platform database runs on CNPG `platform-db`/`product-db` (#496, #543/#544; Kind audit green); the P4 DR drills stay on the RFC-0007 calendar |
| [RFC-0019](RFC-0019/) | ClickHouse for OTel logs/traces SQL (+ optional commerce analytics) | platform-wide | done | implemented (Phase B) — OLAP for OTel logs+traces deployed in local-stack + cluster (#560, [ADR-023](../adr/ADR-023-clickhouse-observability-olap/)); Phase A commerce facts stays out of scope |

Deferred items are listed in the RFC's Implementation History, not dropped |
| [RFC-0022](RFC-0022/) | Adopt Keycloak as the platform identity provider; retire auth-service (supersedes the custom-issuer portions of [RFC-0009](RFC-0009/)) | platform-wide | P1 | Accepted — **implementation absorbed into [RFC-0024](RFC-0024/)** (design record stands) |

| [RFC-0024](RFC-0024/) | Replatform edge and identity: Envoy Gateway + Keycloak, one greenfield cutover (executes [RFC-0022](RFC-0022/); supersedes the Kong vehicle of [RFC-0009](RFC-0009/)/[ADR-006](../adr/ADR-006-rs256-jwt-kong-edge-auth/)) | platform-wide | P1 | **implemented** — P1–P5 + P6 arm A shipped, and the **Kind gate passed 2026-08-25** (ELIGIBLE): all six linked ADRs are `Adoption: Complete`. The two-realm split arrived after acceptance via [ADR-050](../adr/ADR-050-separate-staff-identity-realm/). Still open: the RFC-0022/0023 Kong cross-references |
| [RFC-0025](RFC-0025/) | Converge the customer SPA on the Admin Portal's stack — one cutover, no mocks (exercises [ADR-049](../adr/ADR-049-admin-portal-tanstack-spa/)'s convergence revisit trigger) | service:frontend | P2 | implemented |
| [RFC-0026](RFC-0026/) | Adopt the Temporal Worker Controller for versioned workers; KEDA autoscaling designed and recorded (takes up the destination [ADR-030](../adr/ADR-030-temporal-workflow-versioning/) named but deferred) | platform-wide | done | implemented — [ADR-054](../adr/ADR-054-temporal-worker-controller/) controller, [ADR-055](../adr/ADR-055-keda-worker-autoscaling/) KEDA (`Proposed`, not installed).

| [RFC-0027](RFC-0027/) | Retire Tempo and Jaeger, keeping VictoriaTraces and ClickHouse (five trace sinks to two; the log tier is unchanged by design) | platform-wide | done | implemented — [ADR-058](../adr/ADR-058-retire-jaeger/), [ADR-059](../adr/ADR-059-retire-tempo/) and [ADR-060](../adr/ADR-060-envoy-access-log-transport/) all `Adoption: Complete`; [ADR-057](../adr/ADR-057-span-metrics-in-collector/) followed on 2026-08-24 once the span metrics had a consumer, and [ADR-040](../adr/ADR-040-tempo-community-helm-chart/) is `Withdrawn`. Kind-verified 2026-08-24 on a cluster rebuilt from scratch: 0 Tempo/Jaeger workloads, a 31-edge replacement service graph, and the edge's access log reaching the 90-day store for the first time |
| [RFC-0028](RFC-0028/) | ClickHouse replication (optional least-privilege hardening; research reaches sharding/Distributed — explicitly not built) | infra | P3 | **Accepted** 2026-08-28 — research gate PASSED (all questions owner-resolved: fresh tables, straight 3+3, default replica path, keep default access, schema ownership **reversed at implementation** to a Job-owned `Replicated` database after exporter-owned `ON CLUSTER` DDL was measured reaching 1 of 3 then 2 of 3 replicas); [ADR-065](../adr/ADR-065-clickhouse-replicated-topology/) created at `Accepted` and amended the same day, implementation in the same PR; user model optional side-rung; sharding a documented trigger table, not a deliverable |
| [RFC-0029](RFC-0029/) | PostgreSQL authorization and access governance | platform-wide | P1 | researching — ten-layer model, 25 production scenarios, deep ownership/default-privilege analysis, and CNPG 1.30 boundary; 14/14 experiments and the live catalog/Context7 audit passed, while Phase 0 live rotation and owner gate remain open |

## Backlog — candidate RFCs

Substantial themes gathered from across the repo. Each **reserves the next RFC number**
when someone starts research (owner OK → `research.md` → index `researching`).

| Candidate | Scope | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **RFC-0016** — async payment confirmation via Temporal *(reserved; absorbed into [RFC-0021](RFC-0021/) phase 6 — number retired, do not backfill)* | platform-wide | [RFC-0015](RFC-0015/) |
| **Atlantis** PR-driven Terraform | infra | [`terraform/`](../../../terraform/) |
| **Alert delivery** (Slack via OpenBAO + PagerDuty) | infra | `docs/observability/alerting/` |
| ~~**Trace/log backend consolidation**~~ — **promoted to [RFC-0027](RFC-0027/)** (owner reserved the number 2026-08-23) | platform-wide | [RFC-0014](RFC-0014/), [RFC-0019](RFC-0019/) |
| **Authorization (RBAC/ABAC)** — claim population + enforcement; claim population moves to Keycloak roles under [RFC-0022](RFC-0022/); the first enforcement (role gate + `protected` routes) ships with [RFC-0023](RFC-0023/); fine-grained roles remain here | platform-wide | [RFC-0009](RFC-0009/) O1 |
| **Gateway improvements** — edge `proxy-cache` + dedicated per-env issuer domain; the issuer-domain question is reshaped by the Keycloak realm issuer in [RFC-0022](RFC-0022/) | infra | [RFC-0009](RFC-0009/) O4/O6 |
| ~~**Gateway strategy post-Kong-OSS**~~ — **promoted to [RFC-0024](RFC-0024/)** (owner activated the exit trigger proactively, 2026-08-10) | infra | RFC-0022 § Gateway distribution risk |
| **Chaos / GameDay program** | infra | [`docs/databases/disaster-recovery.md`](../../databases/disaster-recovery.md), DR docs |
| **API v1→v2 versioning policy** | platform-wide | `docs/api/api.md#versioning-and-compatibility` |
| **Split OpenBAO bootstrap** (auth config vs secret seeding) | infra | secrets ESO review |
| **Secret rotation** (CronJob / push) — largely superseded by dynamic DB creds in [RFC-0008](RFC-0008/) | infra | secrets ESO review |
| **PushSecret for operator-generated secrets** (sync CNPG/Zalando creds back to OpenBAO) | infra | secrets ESO review |

_Last updated: 2026-09-05 — **RFC-0029** remains `researching`; its PG18/CNPG experiments, live catalog/HBA sweep, and Context7/source audit passed, while Phase 0 live credential rotation and the owner gate remain open. Previously 2026-09-03 — RFC-0029 opened for PostgreSQL authorization and access governance. Previously 2026-08-28 — **RFC-0028** accepted and implemented, with its schema decision **reversed during implementation**: exporter-owned DDL cannot complete at three replicas, so a bootstrap Job owns the schema in a `Replicated` database. Earlier the same day: research gate passed and README authored at `provisional` (owner resolved every open question in-session; the gate chose exporter-owned Option B). Earlier: opened at `researching` (ClickHouse replication + least-privilege; sharding researched-not-built). Previously 2026-08-25 — the Kind gate passed and **RFC-0023** and **RFC-0024** both
reached `implemented`, converting nine ADRs to `Adoption: Complete` in one run; a docs audit
over the whole tree followed, correcting index rows that had drifted from the records they
point at (this row among them). 2026-08-24 — **RFC-0027** → `implemented`: Tempo (both installs) and Jaeger are
retired, VictoriaTraces + ClickHouse are the two trace sinks, and P6 put the edge's access log on
the OTLP road so it finally reaches the 90-day store. Three of its four ADRs are
`Adoption: Complete`, ADR-057 included once the `red-spanmetrics` and `otel-collector-health`
boards were ported to the cluster, and
ADR-040 is `Withdrawn` — an obligation P4 missed and the P5 docs audit caught. That audit also
found two defects that were not documentation: a **critical** alert deleted as collateral because
it shared a file with `TempoDown`, and a Grafana pivot (`tracesToProfiles`) that turns out to be
Tempo-datasource-only and is now a recorded gap. 2026-08-21 — RFC-0026 **Accepted**: research gate
passed and the Temporal Worker Controller adopted, retiring the per-build manifest and the
hand-run activation Job; ADR-054 and ADR-055 created at `Proposed` (KEDA recorded, not installed).
Previously: RFC-0025 `implemented` (storefront cutover as frontend v3.0.0, ADR-052 Accepted /
Adoption Complete) and RFC-0023 Accepted (Backoffice portal + first `protected` APIs; ADR-047..049
created at Accepted)._
