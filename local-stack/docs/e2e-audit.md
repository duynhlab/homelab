# E2E release audit

This runbook is the mandatory pre-release gate for code exercised by
[local-stack](../README.md). Run it against the exact source commits intended
for release; every Phase A, B, and C row must pass before a tag is created.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Applies to** | Service, `pkg`, frontend, gateway/edge, identity (realm), and Compose changes |
| **Execution** | Full audit every time, on a stack recreated from scratch; phases are not selectively skipped |
| **Evidence** | Candidate commit SHAs plus the completed pass/fail table |
| **Pass decision** | `ELIGIBLE FOR TAG` only when every required row passes |
| **Failure decision** | `BLOCKED`; fix, recreate the stack, and rerun the full audit |

## Preconditions

1. Check out every candidate repository at the commit intended for the tag.

2. **Recreate the stack from scratch. Every run — this is not conditional.**

   ```bash
   docker compose down -v          # drops volumes: databases, telemetry stores, edge state
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   Cumulative telemetry is what makes this mandatory rather than advisory. Half
   of Phase C reads counters, span tables, and log streams that never reset on
   their own, so a re-used stack cannot tell "this candidate produced it" from
   "the previous run left it behind". `docker compose ps --all` proving a clean
   boot is also the only cheap way to catch a migrate or seed job that would
   have failed on an empty database.

   Two cold-start costs are specific to `down -v` and are expected, not faults:

   - **The Envoy binary is re-downloaded.** The control plane obtains the data
     plane at runtime through func-e into the `envoy-gateway-data` volume, which
     `down -v` deletes. The first `up` therefore needs **outbound internet** and
     the edge answers nothing until the download finishes.
   - **`gateway-certgen` must exit 0 before the gateway starts.** It self-signs
     the xDS material the control plane uses to reach its own Envoy child
     process, into the same deleted volume. `docker compose ps --all` must show
     it `Exited (0)`; a non-zero exit means the gateway is not merely slow, it
     will never serve.

3. **Run every shell block in `bash`.** Two zsh behaviours break this runbook,
   and zsh is the macOS default:

   - `USERNAME` is a **special parameter** in zsh, so `USERNAME=alice $KCT`
     silently mints a token for the *host* account. Every row that depends on
     being alice, bob, or carol then fails for a reason that looks like an
     identity bug.
   - zsh does **not word-split unquoted parameters**, so the runbook's
     multi-word command handles — `$TCLI` and `$S` — are passed as ONE argument.
     `agent-browser $S batch …` answers `Unknown command: --session audit`, and
     `$TCLI workflow list … | grep -q …` reports a false FAIL against a Temporal
     namespace that is perfectly healthy.

   `bash` has neither behaviour. Start a `bash` shell before Phase A and stay in
   it for all three phases.

4. Confirm Compose renders and the runtime is ready:

   ```bash
   docker compose config --quiet
   docker compose ps --all
   ```

5. Verify all long-running application dependencies are running or healthy.
   Every migrate and seed job must have exited successfully. Investigate any
   `unhealthy`, restarting, or non-zero exited container before continuing.
   **The `gateway` container is the one exception**: the Envoy Gateway image is
   distroless, so it can declare no healthcheck and only ever reports `Up`.
   Prove the edge is serving before starting Phase A — this is the readiness
   gate the missing healthcheck cannot provide:

   ```bash
   curl -sf http://localhost:8099/readyz                # control plane loaded the config
   # BLOCK here until the data plane serves. Do not substitute "up completed" or
   # even a 200 from /readyz for this: the control plane reports ready as soon as
   # it has parsed the config, which is minutes before a cold-booted Envoy
   # finishes downloading (see the cold-start note in step 2). Every edge row of
   # Phase A returns curl exit 7 / code 000 in that window, which reads like a
   # broken edge rather than a slow one.
   until [ "$(curl -so /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' \
     http://localhost:8080/product/v1/public/products)" = 200 ]; do sleep 10; done
   echo "edge serving"
   ```

   One more edge check belongs here, because it is cheap and it invalidates the
   whole of Phase C when it fails: the control plane must have **attached the
   EnvoyProxy CR**. Without it the edge still answers 200 on every route while
   emitting no spans at all, so Phase A and Phase B pass and only Phase C
   notices:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs gateway 2>&1 | grep -c 'failed to find envoyproxy'   # want 0
   ```

6. Install and load the browser automation guidance before Phase B:

   ```bash
   agent-browser skills get core
   ```

7. Record the candidate commit set:

   ```bash
   for repo in ../../*-service ../../frontend ../../pkg; do
     printf '%-32s ' "$(basename "$repo")"
     git -C "$repo" rev-parse HEAD
   done
   ```

The stack builds directly from these sibling worktrees. Uncommitted files are
part of the build but cannot be represented by a release tag; the final audit
therefore requires clean candidate worktrees.

**Container runtime.** `docker compose` is the documented command and every row
of this runbook works under podman's compose provider too — with **one** exception
that must be handled at bring-up, or two Phase C rows (**C13**, **C14**) come back
empty while the whole stack looks healthy.

`vector` reads the runtime's API socket. Inside a podman machine
`/var/run/docker.sock` is a **symlink** to `/run/user/<uid>/podman/podman.sock`,
and a bind-mounted symlink resolves in the CONTAINER's mount namespace where the
target does not exist — so Vector exits 78 with `Source "docker": Socket not
found: /var/run/docker.sock`. `local-stack/compose.podman.yaml` fixes it, and all
three of its parts are load-bearing: the **resolved** socket path, `userns_mode:
keep-id` (container root is a subuid, not the socket's `core` owner), and
`security_opt: [label=disable]` (the socket carries an SELinux label that denies
the mount even to its owner). Under podman the bring-up in step 2 becomes:

```bash
export PODMAN_SOCKET="$(podman machine ssh readlink -f /var/run/docker.sock | tr -d '\r')"
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://$(podman machine inspect --format '{{.ConnectionInfo.PodmanSocket.Path}}')"
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.podman.yaml down -v
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.podman.yaml up -d --build
```

Only `up` needs the second file — it is what creates the container — and on Docker
the overlay is not needed at all. Confirm before Phase A either way:

```bash
docker compose ps vector                       # want: Up, not Exited
docker compose logs vector 2>&1 | tail -3      # want: "Started watching for container logs"
```

A `vector` that exited means the overlay was **omitted**, not that the container
needs another restart: a plain `up` re-reads `compose.yaml` and remounts the same
broken symlink. Do not start Phase C with `vector` down.

**Request pacing is not required.** The local edge allows 50 requests per second
in a single window — no minute and no hour bucket
(`gateway/eg/backendtrafficpolicy.yaml`) — a limit no shell-driven row can reach
by hand, and one that cannot leak across runs because Envoy's local rate limiter
is an in-process token bucket with no shared datastore. A 429 during this audit
is therefore a real finding: either the policy was tightened or something is
looping. Investigate it, do not wait it out.

**Tokens come from the realm.** Direct Access Grants are disabled on the realm's
clients, so no `grant_type=password` shortcut exists. Every token below is minted
by `scripts/keycloak-token.sh`, a headless Authorization Code + PKCE flow
(read its header before changing anything about identity).

**A token lives 900 seconds, so mint it in the same block that spends it.** The
realm's access-token lifespan is 15 minutes (A1 asserts it), which is ample for a
human typing rows in sequence and *not* ample for a session that pauses between
them — an agent-driven run, or a run interrupted by a question. A token minted at
the top and used twenty minutes later fails as `401` with body `Jwt is expired`,
which reads exactly like an edge misconfiguration and sends the reader hunting
through the SecurityPolicy. If a row needs a token, either run it in the same
shell block as its `$KCT` call or re-mint first; several rows below (A9, A13, A16)
already mint their own for this reason.

Timing is dominated by waits, not by typing: A10 sleeps 13s, A12 polls up to 24s,
A14 restarts `temporal` and waits for it to report healthy, and the conditional
A15 adds roughly 5 minutes of drill. **A13 is the outlier** — it is gated on the
checkout session TTL (30 minutes by default), which is exactly why it is armed
before A1 and read at the end instead of being run in place. **A20** adds its own
wait: it parks an order through a real declined refund and polls for up to 2
minutes, because the compensation has to fail before there is anything to resolve.

```bash
# ---- Preamble. Run this first, in the shell you will use for every row —
#      including A13, which is armed before A1. Skipping it leaves $TCLI, $KCT
#      and audit_curl unset and the arming snippet fails with "command not found".
BASE=http://localhost:8080
KC=http://localhost:8081/realms/duynhlab
KCT=./scripts/keycloak-token.sh        # run this block from homelab/local-stack

# One indirection for every call, kept so pacing could be reinstated in ONE place
# if the edge policy ever tightens. It does not sleep: the local edge allows
# 50 req/s (see Preconditions).
audit_curl() {
  curl "$@"
}

# Every `temporal ...` call in this audit runs in temporal-admintools: the
# `temporalio/server` image ships only the server binary, so
# `exec -T temporal temporal ...` fails with "not found".
TCLI="docker compose exec -T temporal-admintools temporal"

# ---- A13 (arm). Physically here, not down at A13, because the block must be
#      runnable top-to-bottom: the timer needs the session's full TTL (30 min by
#      default) to fire, and A13's read is the LAST thing Phase A does. Arming it
#      in place would read a timer three minutes old and report a false 200.
#
#      It needs its OWN user. One active session per user is a partial unique
#      index, so A9/A10 would adopt this session and every mutation re-arms it.
#      That user is `bob`, a seeded realm user — self-registration is gone with
#      the identity cutover (the realm sets registrationAllowed=false and only an
#      admin API call could create a user), and every other Phase A row is alice.
#      Because the user is a FIXED one, clear any session an earlier run left
#      active first — otherwise the POST below adopts it and A13 silently watches
#      the previous run's timer.

# A15. Worker Deployment Versioning drill (ADR-030, mechanism now ADR-054).
#      CONDITIONAL: run it when a change touches worker versioning, the saga's
#      activity set, or the rollout runbook. It is the only rehearsal of a pinned
#      drain outside the cluster — Compose has no Kubernetes, so it is also the
#      only place the ENV CONTRACT can be gated before Kind.
#
#      The variable is TEMPORAL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME, Temporal's own name: the Worker
#      Controller injects it, Temporal's reference worker reads it, and
#      pkg/temporalx >= temporalx/v0.37.0 reads only it. The retired
#      TEMPORAL_WORKER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME was a synonym this platform invented; a
#      worker given the old name plus a build id sees half a config and exits 1,
#      which is what makes this row a real gate rather than a formality.
#
#      `set-current-version` below is a COMPOSE-ONLY crutch: on the cluster the
#      controller is the sole writer of Current, and running it against Kind fights
#      the controller. Never copy these three invocations to a cluster incident.
#
#      The deployment name here stays the bare `order-fulfillment` because this
#      drill sets it by hand. On the cluster the controller composes
#      `<namespace>/<resource-name>`, so it is `order/order-fulfillment` there.
#
#      Keep the pause UNDER the saga's 30s StartToCloseTimeout
#      (order-service/internal/saga/workflow.go). A longer pause makes every
#      attempt time out and retry forever — MaximumAttempts is 0 — so the drill
#      never converges and strands an in-flight workflow.

## Phase B — real browser (agent-browser, ~8 min)

Two SPAs, run in that order: the storefront (`:3001`, B1-B4) and the Backoffice
Portal (`:3009`, B5-B8, then the ADR-053 affordances B9-B10).

What Phase B proves that Phase A cannot: the SPA holds **no token of its own**.
keycloak-js owns the token lifecycle in adapter memory, the browser never sees an
in-app credential form, and every transition — sign-in, refresh, sign-out — is a
realm endpoint the browser reaches directly, not a service route behind the edge.
Storage-shaped regressions (a token cached "for convenience") and refresh
regressions are invisible to curl and can only be caught here.

`--args "--no-sandbox"` is required on Linux hosts with user-namespace
restrictions (only needed on the first command of a session).

Refs like `@e5` are **not stable** — they are assigned per snapshot and change on
every navigation. Every block below re-snapshots before it clicks; do not carry a
ref across a page load.

```bash
S="--session audit"      # bash only — see Preconditions

# B1. LOGIN THROUGH THE REALM. The SPA has no password field and cannot have
#     one: the realm's `customer-spa` client has Direct Access Grants disabled.
#     /login renders a single button that calls keycloak.login({redirectUri}),
#     a FULL-PAGE redirect to the realm, so the credentials are typed on
#     Keycloak's own page at localhost:8081 — which makes half of this
#     assertion about the ORIGIN CHANGING.
agent-browser $S --args "--no-sandbox" batch \
  "open http://localhost:3001" "wait 2500" "snapshot -i"
# Compose gives `frontend` only `service_started` on the gateway, so on a freshly
# recreated stack the SPA can load a few seconds before the edge accepts
# requests. A first paint with failed API calls is a RETRY, not a failure:
# reload and re-snapshot. The landing page is the HOME page — a search box and
# the category buckets, no product grid — and the header's "Sign in" is a LINK
# to /login carrying ?redirect= for the page you were on.

agent-browser $S batch "click @e8" "wait 1500" "get url" "snapshot -i"
# want url http://localhost:3001/login?redirect=%2F — the home page writes no
# search params, so the encoded return path is just the root. (A `page=1` here
# would be the regression 3.1.0 fixed: a schema default that the router wrote
# into the address bar before anyone had paged.) The snapshot must show a
# "Continue to sign in" button — take its ref from the one just printed:
agent-browser $S batch "click @e11" "wait 3000" "get url" "snapshot -i"
# ASSERTION 1 — the origin changed. `get url` must now be
#   http://localhost:8081/realms/duynhlab/protocol/openid-connect/auth?...
#   ...response_type=code&code_challenge_method=S256...
# and the snapshot must show Keycloak's own form: "Username or email",
# "Password", "Sign In". A password field served from :3001 is a FAILED row.
agent-browser $S batch "fill @e2 alice" "fill @e4 password123" "click @e3" \
  "wait 3000" "get url"
# want: back on http://localhost:3001/ — the home page, which is where the
# ?redirect= said to return to.
agent-browser $S snapshot -i | grep -E 'Sign out|Orders|Profile'
# ASSERTION 2 — signed-in state: the header carries Orders, the cart and bell
# badges, a Profile control (an icon button, aria-label "Profile (alice)") and
# Sign out, instead of a Sign in link. Checkout appears only when the cart is
# non-empty, so do not require it here.

# ASSERTION 3 — NO TOKEN IN WEB STORAGE. Enumerate BOTH storages and assert that
# nothing in either one is JWT-shaped. localStorage legitimately holds a `theme`
# preference, and during a checkout a `checkoutIdemKey:<session-id>` UUID; the
# assertion is written against the VALUES, not against known key names, because
# the point is that no key holds a token whatever it is called.

#     THE DIALOG HAS NO REFS. It opens and renders correctly — `screenshot`
#     and `read` both show it — but the portal's dialogs carry `role="dialog"`
#     WITHOUT `aria-modal`, and neither `snapshot` nor `snapshot -i` surfaces
#     their fields. So there is nothing to `click`/`type` by ref, and a missing
#     ref here is NOT a failed row. Drive it through the DOM instead. React
#     controlled inputs ignore a plain `.value =`, so go through the native
#     setter and dispatch `input`, or the field reverts on the next render:
#
#       agent-browser $Q eval "(() => {
#         const set = (el, v) => {
#           Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(el.constructor.prototype, 'value')

#
#     `read` is what reads the advisory line back; the submit is the same shape,
#     clicking the dialog's own `Receive` button. Ref-driven flows work normally
#     everywhere else on the page — this applies only to the dialogs.
# Fill a SKU id that has no balance row (b9-<epoch> is untracked by
# construction), warehouse 1, quantity 4 — and BEFORE submitting, the advisory
# line must read "No balance row yet — this receipt creates it."
# After Receive: "Stock received." Then filter the balances table by that SKU
# and assert the new row exists with on-hand 4, and the movements ledger shows
# RECEIVE with duyne's subject (d0e00000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001).

# B10. THE PUBLISH WARNING fires and does not gate. Create a draft in the

#      and in the confirm dialog assert BOTH:
#        - the amber notice "No inventory balance row exists for SKU …"
#        - the Publish button is still ENABLED (warn, never gate)
#      then Publish and assert the row reads ACTIVE.

## Phase C — telemetry sanity (curl + PromQL + LogsQL + SQL, ~6 min)

The stack ships the full RFC-0014/0017/0019 telemetry pipeline, and a change can
pass A+B while silently breaking any leg of it. Phase C therefore walks **every**
leg — four signals, five stores, six export paths — rather than sampling one
query per backend. It is run **after** Phase A, because most of what it reads is
produced by Phase A's flow.

Three things to hold in mind before the first query:

- **Wait 30–45 seconds after the last driven request.** The services export OTLP
  on a 15s interval, the spanmetrics connector flushes on 15s, and the
  fulfillment saga is asynchronous. Every row below inherits this lag; a row that
  reads empty inside that window is *pending*, not failed. The lookback windows
  are **45 minutes** for the same reason in reverse: Phase A takes about ten
  minutes and Phase B another five, so a 15-minute window would drop A1–A10 out
  of range and make a healthy stack look uninstrumented.
- **The edge is the trace root now.** Envoy is the first span of every
  browser/curl-driven trace, so C2 and C3 are the rows that prove the trace
  actually starts where the request entered the platform.
- **Two ports are deliberately host-unreachable, and neither was forgotten.**
  Envoy's Prometheus endpoint and its admin interface are not published: the
  compose stack exposes only `8080` (proxy) and `8099` (control plane
  `/readyz`). Proxy stats ARE scraped — in-network, by vmagent's `envoy` job
  against the bootstrap-merged `:19005` listener (C20 asserts it) — they are
  just not a host-side surface. Likewise the collector's OTLP **gRPC**
  receiver on `:4317` is not published; it is reachable only from inside the
  compose network, which is exactly what the edge needs and why no host-side
  generator can stand in for it.

# ---- TRACES ----------------------------------------------------------------

# C2. THE EDGE SPAN EXISTS AND IS THE TRACE ROOT. The most important row in this
#     phase: it is the only proof that the edge is still a span producer. The edge
#     does not set `service.name` explicitly anywhere in gateway/eg/ — Envoy
#     Gateway derives it from the Gateway's identity as `<gateway>.<namespace>`,
#     which for gateway/eg/gateway.yaml plus the file provider's default namespace
#     is `platform.envoy-gateway-system`. DISCOVER it rather than trusting this
#     line: the derivation is upstream behaviour and a rename of the Gateway
#     changes it. The NOT-IN list must name every OTHER span producer including
#     the two workers (own identities since 2026-08-17, the C8 fix) and
#     keycloak (a span producer since its tracing enablement) — a name
#     missing here multiplies into FOUND, and the tr strips the newlines, so C2
#     prints a concatenated blob and C6 inherits it through $EDGE. Found the

# instrumentation leg. **Thirteen** series on a full stack: the ten application
# services, `mockpay`, and the two workers, which carry their own identities
# (`order-worker`, `checkout-worker`) exactly as they do in the cluster.
#
# This read eleven until 2026-08-17, when compose gave each worker its service's
# `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` and this note called that "sharing the series by design".
# It was not sharing. Two processes exporting the same `service.name` with no
# distinguishing resource attribute overwrite each other's samples, so the value

# ---- LOGS ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# VictoriaLogs holds TWO independent ingest legs and they are told apart by their
# STREAM FIELD, which is the only reliable discriminator:
#   * OTLP leg  — the Go services' otelzap tee -> collector -> VictoriaLogs. The
#     collector's `VL-Stream-Fields: service.name` header makes `service.name` the
#     stream identity, so these streams are `_stream:{"service.name"="cart"}`.
#   * Vector leg — `docker_logs` tails container stdout for everything WITHOUT an
#     OTel SDK (the edge, infra, the SPA) and ships with
#     `_stream_fields=service,container_name`, so these streams are
#     `_stream:{service="gateway"}`.
# `checkout`, `checkout-worker`, `inventory` and `mockpay` are NOT in Vector's
# exclude list, so their lines land TWICE — once per leg, under different stream
# fields. That duplication is by design; it is not a regression to chase.

# C12. App logs, OTLP leg.
curl -s "$VL" --data-urlencode 'query=_time:45m _stream:{"service.name"="cart"} | count()'
# want a non-zero count(*). Enumerate the whole leg with:
curl -s http://localhost:9428/select/logsql/stream_field_values \
  --data-urlencode 'query=_time:45m' --data-urlencode 'field=service.name'
# want every service Phase A drove.

# C13. EDGE ACCESS LOGS, Vector leg. The second-most important row in this phase:
#      the edge's JSON access log is the only structured record of what the edge
#      did, and the field set is contracted in gateway/eg/envoyproxy.yaml.
#
#      `_stream:{service="gateway"}` alone is NOT enough — that same stream also
#      carries the control plane's own debug logs (xDS snapshots, JWKS fetches),
#      which are far more numerous. `upstream_cluster` and `route_name` exist only
#      on access-log lines, so requiring both is the discriminator.
curl -s "$VL" --data-urlencode \
  'query=_time:45m _stream:{service="gateway"} upstream_cluster:* route_name:* | count()'
# want a non-zero count(*). Then pin the specific request driven in C0:
curl -s "$VL" --data-urlencode \
  "query=_time:45m _stream:{service=\"gateway\"} upstream_cluster:* uri:\"audit=$TAG\"" \
  --data-urlencode 'limit=1'
# want ONE line, whose `_stream` is {container_name="local-stack-gateway-1",
# service="gateway"} and whose parsed fields are the CR's contract:
#   uri=/product/v1/public/products?audit=$TAG  status=200  method=GET
#   upstream_cluster=httproute/envoy-gateway-system/api-product/rule/0
#   route_name=.../match/0/*  upstream=<ip:8080>  duration=<ms>  request_id=<uuid>
# `host` is in the CR's JSON but never reaches VictoriaLogs: the Vector
# transform's `del(.host)` (aimed at docker_logs' machine-hostname field) runs
# after the JSON parse and takes the access log's authority with it. As-built
# quirk, not a regression — do not assert on `host`.
# Read those FIELD NAMES, not just the values: with the EnvoyProxy CR unattached
# Envoy falls back to its built-in JSON, which reports the same facts as
# `x-envoy-origin-path`, `response_code` and `upstream_host` — every Vector-parsed
# edge panel breaks on that rename while this row would still find "a log line".

# C14. Vector is tailing NON-app containers too — the half of the log estate that
#      has no OTel SDK at all. `frontend` is the right witness: it is the SPA's
#      web server, so Phase B guarantees it produced lines, and nothing but Vector
#      can carry them.
curl -s "$VL" --data-urlencode 'query=_time:45m _stream:{service="frontend"} | count()'
# want a non-zero count(*). Enumerate the whole leg to see who else is covered:

  --data-urlencode 'query=_time:45m' --data-urlencode 'field=service'
# expect the chatty infra containers (otel-collector, pyroscope, grafana, postgres)
# plus gateway, frontend, and the double-shipped app containers. A QUIET container
# is a bad witness, not a failure: `temporal` logs almost nothing once it is up, so
# an empty `_stream:{service="temporal"}` proves nothing either way.
# C13 + C14 both empty, with `service.name` streams healthy, is ONE failure, not
# two: the Vector leg is down. `docker compose logs vector` names the cause; under
# podman `Socket not found: /var/run/docker.sock` means the stack was brought up
# WITHOUT compose.podman.yaml, and the fix is a re-bring-up with the overlay, not
# a restart (see the container-runtime note in Preconditions).

# C15. LOG <-> TRACE CORRELATION. A log line that carries its TraceId is what
#      makes "jump from this log to that trace" work in Grafana; without it both
#      stores are populated and still useless together.

## Pass criteria

| # | Check | Expectation |
|---|-------|-------------|
| A1 | Realm token (PKCE) | `scripts/keycloak-token.sh` mints a JWT whose `iss` is the realm, whose `aud` includes `duynhlab-platform`, and whose `sub` is alice's fixed UUID **as a string** (ADR-042 evidence); `refresh_token` + `expires_in` present |
| A2 | Private routes w/ realm token | 200 through the Envoy edge JWT filter |
| A3 | Bad/missing token | 401 **at the edge**, `text/plain` body `Jwt is missing`, **and** `www-authenticate: Bearer realm="<requested URL>"` — plus `error="invalid_token"` when a token was present but unverifiable. All three are required |
| A4 | Refresh reuse (realm) | refresh rotates; replaying the consumed token 400 `invalid_grant` / `Maximum allowed refresh token reuse exceeded`; the replay revokes the family, so the rotated token also 400s (`Session doesn't have required client`) |
| A5 | Logout (realm) | end-session 204, replay **also 204** (idempotent); refresh afterwards 400 `Session not active` |
| A6 | Removed surfaces | `/auth/v1/private/*` 404 (no HTTPRoute matches) **and the `auth` database does not exist** — auth-service is removed from local-stack; its cluster surface retires in RFC-0024 P5 |
| A7 | v3 paths (ADR-017) | new `shipments/*` paths 200 and the deprecated `shipping/v1/public/track` alias still 200 (expand phase). The old `auth/v1/public/login` alias is **not** checked — it certified the retired token layer and has no backend |
| A8 | Internal audience sealed | renamed `notify/*` + `internal/orders/*` 404 in-container (no aliases); and the two `/internal/` paths that DO exist — product create, cart clear — 404 **at the edge** because every HTTPRoute is audience-scoped, so no audience leaks |
| A9 | Checkout sessions (RFC-0015) | lifecycle **201**→200→200→200 through edge-JWT, with the create's 201 asserted (not just used for its id); no-token 401; `/api/v1/checkout` 404; price bump flags `price_changed` |
| A10 | Confirm + abandonment (RFC-0015 P2–P4) | fee/tax/promo composition asserted; `Idempotency-Key` required; replay = same order; order reaches `confirmed` or `completed`; order total == session total; lazy-410 past `expires_at` |
| A11 | Full-fleet fan-out | product details returns product, live inventory availability, reviews, and review summary |
| A12 | Cancellation unwind (ADR-033) | cancel 202 then replay 200; order reaches `cancelled`; `CancellationWorkflow` execution `Completed`; the `cancellation_requests` row for that order is `DISPATCHED` and its `epoch` matches the `-v<n>` suffix of a `CancellationWorkflow` id — **asserted**, not merely printed |
| A13 | Abandonment timer (ADR-019) | on a **dedicated user** (`bob`, after clearing any leftover session), an untouched session past its TTL reads 410 and the row is `expired \| timer`. `lazy` is inconclusive, not a pass — it proves only the backstop |
| A14 | Temporal durability | execution count is unchanged and non-zero across `restart temporal`; the driven workflow's history is still readable |
| A16 | String subject persisted (ADR-042) | a cart write made with a realm token lands in `cart.cart_items.user_id` as the caller's realm UUID — the edge, `pkg/authmw`, the handler, and the column all agree |
| A15 | Versioning drill (conditional) | deployment registers, workflow reports `Pinned` on the current build, the superseded version reports `draining`, and the teardown leaves no `Running` workflow behind |
| A17 | Protected surface (RFC-0023 + ADR-050) | tokenless 401 **at the edge**; bare `/inventory/v1/private/*` 404 (only `/protected` is routed); a valid **customer-realm** token 401 **wrong-issuer at the edge** (the ADR-050 fence — stronger than the old in-service 403); staff operator `duyne` (realm `duynhlab-staff`) lists real balances with derived `atp`; receipt 201 `applied:true`, exact replay 200 `applied:false`, invariant-violating adjustment 409 `STOCK_UNAVAILABLE`; the movement row's `actor` is duyne's staff-realm `sub` (`d0e00000-…-001`) |
| A18 | Protected read fan-out (Train 3) | order/payment/shipping/user each answer the staff operator's list 200 **and** reject a customer-realm token 401 at the edge; payment's `reconciliations/runs` pages 200 |
| A19 | Protected catalog writes (slice B) | staff list 200 / customer token 401 at the edge; create lands **DRAFT** (v1) and 404s publicly; duplicate name 409; publish makes it public and a second publish is **409 `INVALID_TRANSITION`**; an edit at v2 succeeds and the same version again is **409 `VERSION_CONFLICT`**; archive 404s the page; the audit trail's newest action is `ARCHIVE` and every row's `actor_sub` is duyne's staff subject — a body-supplied actor is ignored; categories page 200 |
| A20 | Operator resolve (train 7 / ADR-051) | a real declined refund (total's cents `07`) parks the order in **`manual_review`** through the cancellation compensation, not through SQL; the case view carries `version`, the payment/reservation/shipment truths and the transition history, with `degraded` listing only what actually failed; a customer token is **401 wrong-issuer at the edge** on the command; an empty note and a reason from another command's vocabulary are both **400**; an illegal target is **409 `INVALID_TRANSITION`**; a version the order is not at is **409 `VERSION_CONFLICT`**; the decision itself is **201 `applied:true`**, an identical retry **200 `applied:false`** with no second history row, and a further resolve **409** (no longer parked); the `OPERATOR` history row carries `WRITTEN_OFF`, the note, and duyne's staff subject **even though the body named another actor** |
| A21 | Untracked SKU is a conflict, not an outage (ADR-053) | a published product with NO balance row carts fine, and session create answers **flat `409 ITEM_NOT_ORDERABLE`** with **no `Retry-After`** and an opaque body (the SKU ids stay in the log/span); after an operator receipt the SAME basket creates a session — the operator fix, not a retry, is what clears the state. The confirm arm's 409-with-requoted-session envelope is pinned by checkout-service's own contract tests on the same commit |
| A22 | The attention cards' six reads (RFC-0023) | the five count queries the portal dashboard issues each answer **200** with a **numeric `total_items`** (zero is a legitimate count; a missing or non-numeric field is not), the recent-orders panel honours `page_size=5`, and a status order-service does not know is **400** — which is what proves the `manual_review` and `cancelling` cards are genuinely filtered rather than both reporting the total order count |
| B1 | Login through the realm | the sign-in button changes the ORIGIN to `localhost:8081` and the credentials are typed on Keycloak's page; back on the SPA the header shows signed-in state (Products, Orders, Profile, Sign out) and the URL carries no `page` param; **no JWT-shaped value in localStorage or sessionStorage** — a `theme` preference and a `checkoutIdemKey:<uuid>` are legitimate residents, a JWT-shaped value is not; the code-exchange response carries the refresh token and its access token has `iss=http://localhost:8081/realms/duynhlab` with a string UUID `sub` |
| B2 | Adapter refresh | with a 60s client-level token lifespan, driving a private page after the token is due produces **exactly one** `POST …/openid-connect/token` with `grant_type=refresh_token` (the one `authorization_code` grant from a full page load's check-sso is expected and not counted); every `:8080` call 200; no bounce to `/login`; **the lifespan override is restored** |
| B3 | Logout via end-session | logout is a **GET** to `…/protocol/openid-connect/logout` with `post_logout_redirect_uri` + `id_token_hint`, and **no POST reaches any service**; back on the SPA unauthenticated (Sign in link, no Sign out button); a private route afterwards renders a sign-in prompt in place — **no order data from the previous session** — instead of the pre-RFC-0025 bounce to `/login`; sessionStorage empty and localStorage holds nothing token-shaped |
| B4 | Browser cleanup (storefront) | the `audit` session is closed, so a later run starts from a clean profile |
| B5 | Portal sign-in through the **staff** realm | an unauthenticated `:3009` load lands on `/login` with one "Sign in with Keycloak" button and no password field; the button changes the ORIGIN to `localhost:8081` **and the realm in the path is `duynhlab-staff`** — `realms/duynhlab` here means the container was built with the storefront's realm arg; after `duyne` signs in the shell renders with the seven primary nav items and a Sign out control (a landing on `/forbidden` is a role failure, not a sign-in failure); **no JWT-shaped value in either web storage** |
| B6 | Portal dashboard reads real numbers | all five cards present — Low / out of stock, Manual review, Cancelling, Unresolved attempts, Recon discrepancies (latest run) — each showing a numeral rather than a dash or a spinner, and every `:8080` call behind them 200. Zero is a legitimate value; a blank or missing card is not. Requires Phase A to have run first |
| B7 | The realm split is a fence in the browser | in a **clean** profile (`portal-neg`, so no staff SSO cookie), the customer account `alice` / `password123` typed on the portal's realm page stays on `localhost:8081` with "Invalid username or password."; a rendered portal shell after those credentials is a FAILED row and means the two realms share a user store |
| B8 | Browser cleanup (portal) | both the `portal` and `portal-neg` sessions are closed |
| B9 | Portal bootstrap reaches an untracked SKU (ADR-053) | the page-level **Receive first stock** dialog accepts a free-entry SKU id with no balance row; the advisory line reads "No balance row yet — this receipt creates it." before submit; after Receive the balances table shows the new row and the ledger carries the `RECEIVE` with duyne's staff subject |
| B10 | Publish warns, never gates (ADR-053) | publishing a fresh (untracked-by-construction) draft shows the amber "No inventory balance row exists for SKU …" notice inside the confirm dialog while the **Publish button stays enabled**, and the publish succeeds |
| C1 | Collector | 0 export failures / error lines |
| C2 | Edge span is the trace root | the discovery query returns exactly one non-application service name (`platform.envoy-gateway-system`, derived by Envoy Gateway from `<gateway>.<namespace>` — discovered, not assumed) and the ROOT span of the tagged request is the edge's `ingress` Server span; the `deployment.environment.name=local` customTag corroborates it |
| C3 | Trace continuity edge→service | one `TraceId` holds the edge **and** the service, with exactly one root and the service's Server span carrying a non-empty `ParentSpanId` |
| C4 | Per-service span coverage | every service Phase A drove appears in `otel.otel_traces` with `server_spans > 0`, plus the edge |
| C5 | ClickHouse (RFC-0019) | `otel.otel_traces` and `otel.otel_logs` non-empty after the driven flow (SQL over `:8123`) |
| C6 | Trace service coverage | the **10** application service names local-stack runs **plus the edge** are present in **VictoriaTraces' Jaeger-compatible query API** (`:10428/select/jaeger/api/services`) — there is no Jaeger container. `mockpay` also appears and is legitimate but not required; `auth` must be **absent** |
| C7 | spanmetrics / RED leg | `spanmetrics_calls_total{span_kind="SPAN_KIND_SERVER"}` > 0 and `spanmetrics_duration_milliseconds_bucket` present — proves the connector plus the remote-write path |
| C8 | App semconv metrics leg | `http_server_request_duration_seconds_count`, `rpc_server_call_duration_seconds_count{service_name="inventory"}` (the only metrics evidence for gRPC-only inventory), and `go_goroutine_count` all have series |
| C9 | Business counters | confirmed = saga = authorized for flows driven since the last process restart (after ~45s). A14/A15 reset the saga counter; then the durable evidence settles it — every `OrderFulfillmentWorkflow` `Completed`, every confirmed order `completed`. `auth_*` counters are **not** asserted |
| C10 | Temporal metrics, both halves | SDK: latency histograms + `temporal_workflow_completed`, worker slots, pollers have series (bare names, no `_total`); server: `up{job="temporal"}` is 1 and `service_requests` / `persistence_requests` rate — the :8000 listener `PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT` enables |
| C11 | DB client p95 | real ms-scale value (< 500ms), not bucket-collapse garbage |
| C12 | App logs (OTLP leg) | `_stream:{"service.name"="cart"}` non-empty in VictoriaLogs, and the stream-field enumeration lists every service Phase A drove |
| C13 | Edge access logs (Vector leg) | `_stream:{service="gateway"}` filtered on `upstream_cluster:*` + `route_name:*` (the discriminator against the control plane's debug logs in the same stream) is non-empty, and the tagged request is findable **under the CR's field names** — `uri`, `status`, `method`, `upstream`, `upstream_cluster`, `route_name`, `duration`, `request_id` (`host` never reaches VL — Vector's `del(.host)` cleanup eats it; as-built quirk) — not Envoy's built-in fallback names |
| C14 | Vector infra tailing | a non-application container's logs are present, e.g. `_stream:{service="frontend"}`, and the stream enumeration covers the infra containers. C13 + C14 both empty = one failure (the Vector leg), not two |
| C15 | Log↔trace correlation | `otel.otel_logs` rows with a non-empty `TraceId` > 0 |
| C16 | Profiling | Pyroscope's `service_name` label values cover the 10 applications (Connect-RPC `LabelValues` with `matchers` and an explicit ms time range); `pyroscope` itself is expected, `auth` must be absent |
| C17 | Grafana datasources | `/api/datasources` returns exactly the five expected uid/type pairs (VictoriaLogs included) and each `/api/datasources/uid/<uid>/health` answers `OK` |
| C18 | Dashboard inventory | `/api/search?type=dash-db` returns exactly the 18 provisioned uids (incl. the three vendored Envoy Gateway dashboards plus the hand-authored Edge Overview board under Gateway/, the collector-health board, the Keycloak Identity board, and the two RFC-0021-era parity copies) and each loads via `/api/dashboards/uid/…` with 200 |
| C19 | Panels return data | `/api/ds/query` returns a non-empty frame for one representative query per datasource (VictoriaMetrics PromQL, ClickHouse SQL) — a healthy datasource that cannot shape a frame still renders "No data" |
| C20 | Engine-health scrape | vmagent (`:8429/api/v1/targets`) shows all six jobs — `clickhouse`, `otel-collector`, `envoy-gateway` (edge control plane :19001), `envoy` (proxy native stats :19005), `temporal` (server :8000) and `keycloak` (management :9000) — with `health: up`; a missing target means the C21 rules evaluate against nothing |
| C21 | Alert rules loaded, none firing | vmalert (`:8880/api/v1/rules`) reports exactly **18 alerting** rules (9 ClickHouse engine + 2 collector + 3 inventory + 4 keycloak) plus **15 recording** rules (RFC-0021 + inventory) and zero `firing` on a healthy stack — the counts are the tripwire for a silently unmounted rule file |

Any failed row blocks the release tag. Two rows share one root cause and must be
reported as such: **C13 + C14** both empty while C12 is healthy means the Vector
leg is down, not that two log paths regressed — check `vector` per the
container-runtime note in Preconditions, recreate the stack, and rerun.

When a change touches the order-fulfillment path, additionally run the saga
(checkout in the SPA) and watch it complete in the Temporal UI.

## Release evidence

Copy this block into the service PR or release record and replace every pending
value. Preserve the candidate SHA list with the audit result.

This audit now also gates the **identity cutover** (RFC-0024 P3) and the **edge
migration**: A1–A5 are the realm's contract, A2/A3/A8 are the Envoy edge's, and
A16 is the string-subject contract the fleet's databases were migrated for.
Changes to `local-stack/gateway/eg/`, `local-stack/keycloak/duynhlab-realm.json`,
or the cluster's `kubernetes/infra/configs/envoy-gateway/` therefore need this
evidence table too, not just service and `pkg` changes.

### local-stack pre-release evidence

- Candidate repository/tag:
- Candidate commit:
- Supporting repository SHAs:
- Executed at:
- Container runtime:
- Stack recreated with `down -v` + `up -d --build` before this audit: yes (mandatory)
- Edge `service.name` discovered in C2:

| Phase | Checks | Result | Evidence / failure |
|-------|--------|--------|--------------------|
| A | A1–A14 + A16–A21 API contract | PASS / FAIL | |
| A | A15 versioning drill | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| B | B1–B10 real browser | PASS / FAIL | |
| C | C1–C21 telemetry + engine-health loop | PASS / FAIL | |

Decision: ELIGIBLE FOR TAG / BLOCKED
```

The decision is `BLOCKED` when any row fails, evidence is missing, a candidate
worktree is dirty, or the commit to tag differs from the recorded commit. After
a passing decision, continue with the
[semver-to-Kind handoff](../README.md#promote-a-passing-candidate-to-kind).

## Failure and cleanup

- Treat HTTP 429 as a finding, not pacing: the local limit is 50 req/s, so an
  audit row cannot reach it by hand.
- Treat a 401 on a private route as an EDGE question first:
  `docker compose logs --since 10m gateway` shows both the control plane's config
  load and Envoy's own output. A JWKS that was unreachable at boot, or an `iss`
  mismatch between the token and `gateway/eg/securitypolicy.yaml`, produces a
  fleet-wide 401 that looks exactly like a broken service.
- Treat an edge that answers 200 but produces no spans as a CONFIG failure, not a
  collector failure: `docker compose logs gateway 2>&1 | grep 'failed to find
  envoyproxy'` tells you the EnvoyProxy CR never attached, in which case tracing
  and the JSON access log were never configured at all.
- Treat telemetry lag as pending, not passing. Wait for the documented export
  window and rerun the query.
- Use `docker compose logs --since 10m <service>` to localize failures.
- **Every rerun starts with `docker compose down -v` + `up -d --build`.** There is
  no such thing as a partial rerun of this audit: the counters, span tables, and
  log streams that half of Phase C reads are cumulative, so a fix verified against
  a warm stack proves nothing about the candidate.
- Always close the named `agent-browser` session, including after a failed
  browser phase.
- If B2 failed part-way, confirm the client-level token lifespan override was
  restored before doing anything else — a 60s access token left on `customer-spa`
  makes unrelated rows fail in confusing ways.

_Last updated: 2026-08-15 — realigns **Phase B** with the storefront rebuilt by
RFC-0025: the header's "Sign in" is a link to
`/login` carrying `?redirect=`, the sign-out control reads "Sign out", and the
storage assertion now names the legitimate residents (`theme`, and a
`checkoutIdemKey:<uuid>` during a checkout) while still failing on anything
JWT-shaped. B3 changes what it asserts, not how strictly: a private route after
sign-out renders a sign-in prompt **in place** rather than bouncing to `/login`,
so the row now checks the property that mattered — that no order data from the
previous session survives — instead of the redirect that used to carry it. A10
gains a spent-cap row: a promo whose redemptions are used up answers `409
PROMO_EXHAUSTED`, which it did not before checkout-service 0.7.1. The evidence
table's Phase A line said `A1–A14 + A16`, three rows behind the audit itself._

_Previously, 2026-08-12 — makes a from-scratch stack recreation mandatory for
every run and rewrites the two phases that had drifted from reality. **Phase B**
is rebuilt around the browser's real identity flow: the SPA has no credential
form, so B1 asserts the redirect to the realm's own login page, that no
JWT-shaped value exists in either web storage, and the realm claims of the token
actually in use; B2 observes the keycloak-js pre-emptive refresh inside a bounded
window using a temporary 60s client-level token lifespan; B3 asserts the
end-session GET redirect and that no service participates in sign-out. **Phase C**
grows from 6 rows to 19 so no telemetry leg is sampled by proxy — the edge span as
the trace root (with the derived `service.name` discovered at runtime), edge→service
trace continuity, per-service span coverage, spanmetrics, app semconv metrics,
Temporal SDK metrics, both VictoriaLogs ingest legs with the access-log
discriminator, log↔trace correlation, profiling, datasource health, and panels
actually returning data. A3/A4/A5 no longer carry "confirm on the first run"
placeholders: the `www-authenticate` challenge, realm family revocation, and
idempotent logout were measured and are asserted. A9 asserts its 201 and A12
asserts the outbox epoch against the workflow id instead of printing both.
The gate now runs against local-stack's post-auth-service end state: A6 asserts
the `auth` DATABASE is gone rather than a table inside it, A7 drops the retired
`auth/v1/public/login` alias, and the trace/profile coverage sets are the ten
remaining applications plus the edge (the cluster surface retires in RFC-0024 P5).
Preconditions carry the podman bring-up (`compose.podman.yaml` — resolved socket,
`userns_mode: keep-id`, `label=disable`) without which the Vector log leg is
silently absent. Envoy's admin and proxy Prometheus endpoints, and the collector's
unpublished gRPC receiver, are documented as out of scope with reasons so nothing
reads as forgotten._
