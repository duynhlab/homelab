# ClickHouseInstallation is skipped, and the reason is a stale upstream schema
# rather than a shortcut: the datree CRDs-catalog copy of
# clickhouseinstallation_v1.json declares spec.configuration.zookeeper with
# additionalProperties:false and without the `keeper` property that operator
# 0.27.1 added, so it rejects a CORRECT manifest
# ("additional properties 'keeper' not allowed" — reproduced 2026-08-28).
# -ignore-missing-schemas does not help: the schema is found, it is just old.
# The ClickHouseKeeperInstallation schema IS current and does validate, which is
# the CR this train adds and the one a typo would most likely land in.

# Worker Versioning wiring, RFC-0026 / ADR-054 shape.
#
# The controller now owns the version identity: it derives the Build ID and
# injects TEMPORAL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME + TEMPORAL_WORKER_BUILD_ID into every pod of
# every version it creates. So the three-way build-id comparison this function
# used to make has nothing left to compare — there is one file, and it states the
# Build ID nowhere. What replaces it are the mistakes that ARE still reachable,
# and every one of them fails the same way the old drift did: silently, with new
# workflows pinned to a version no worker serves.
#
# Written to fail LOUDLY rather than skip: every path that cannot make a
# comparison exits non-zero. A guard that silently compares nothing is worse than
# no guard, because its green line reads as proof.
