# Flux Operator bootstrap for the duynhlab homelab.
#
# Terraform/OpenTofu owns only the ephemeral bootstrap mechanism (namespace,
# RBAC, the bootstrap Job). The Job installs Flux Operator and applies the
# FluxInstance with create-if-missing semantics, then Flux adopts those
# resources and reconciles steady-state. When manifests are unchanged,
# `tofu plan` shows zero diff.
#
# The FluxInstance manifest is the single source of truth shared with the
# kubectl/kustomize flow it replaces:
#   kubernetes/clusters/<cluster_name>/flux-system/instance.yaml

      # Keycloak SSO for the web UI at ui.duynh.me (ADR-062 recipe, third

      # kubernetes/infra/configs/flux-web/ — no secret literal here or in
      # git). The CA mount is the live-issuer trust anchor for the
      # https://id.duynh.me issuer (flux-web-idp-trust Certificate, same fix
      # class as openbao-idp-trust). SSL_CERT_DIR — not SSL_CERT_FILE — on
      # purpose: Go ADDS the dir's certs to the default system FILES, whereas
      # SSL_CERT_FILE would replace them and break the operator's own TLS to
      # ghcr.io (distribution manifests). Both Secrets are created by the
      # flux-web-local wave, which reconciles AFTER bootstrap — the operator
      # tolerates a missing config secret at start (UI serves anonymous-off
